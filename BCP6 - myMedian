/*Median of Means
You are a teacher and would like to calculate the median grade of your three students. Each student's grade is caclulated as the mean of their three test scores.
Write two functions mean and median. Both functions should accept three arguments and calculate the mean and median respectively. Try to include only one return statement in each function.
Test your two functions by calculating the median grade for the class below. The class is represented as an array of arrays, where each inner array represents a student, and contains their three test scores.
*/
// calculate mean of nested arrays
// calculate median of these three numbers
